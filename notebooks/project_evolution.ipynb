    "# Understanding Project Evolution: From Notebook to Module\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains the relationship between the original analysis notebook, the sample notebook, and the Python module structure in the wet bulb temperature analysis project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The project has evolved in the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Original Analysis** (`data_analysis_of_wet_bulb_temperature.ipynb`): \n",
    "   - Comprehensive academic-style analysis with detailed background, methodology, and findings\n",
    "   - All code in a single notebook with minimal modularization\n",
    "   - Focus on research findings and interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modular Python Package** (`src/` directory):\n",
    "   - Code extracted into reusable modules with proper documentation\n",
    "   - Clear separation of concerns: data processing, visualization, modeling, etc.\n",
    "   - Google-style docstrings added to all functions\n",
    "   - Enhanced maintainability and reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis Scripts** (`scripts/` directory):\n",
    "   - Command-line utility scripts that use the modular code\n",
    "   - Automated workflows for common tasks\n",
    "   - Proper import paths for using modules"

    "- Detailed academic background and literature review\n",
    "- Comprehensive data exploration\n",
    "- In-line code for all preprocessing, visualization, and modeling\n",
    "- Research findings and policy implications\n",

    "### Sample Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample notebook (`sample_analysis.ipynb`):\n",
    "- Demonstrates how to use the refactored modules\n",
    "- Focuses on practical application rather than research background\n",
    "- Imports functions from the `src/` modules instead of defining functions in-line\n",
